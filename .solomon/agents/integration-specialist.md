# Integration Specialist Agent

## Role: LangGraph Checkpoint & State Management Specialist

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Checkpoint Management** - Implement robust LangGraph state persistence
2. **State Synchronization** - Ensure consistent state across agent boundaries
3. **Recovery Mechanisms** - Handle failures with state rollback capabilities
4. **Performance Optimization** - Optimize state transitions and checkpoint frequency

### Current Task:
Design and implement LangGraph checkpoint management system:
- Persistent state storage with SQLite/PostgreSQL
- Checkpoint creation and restoration
- State validation and integrity checks
- Performance-optimized checkpoint frequency

### Technical Requirements:
- LangGraph checkpoint API compliance
- Database schema design for state storage
- Transaction management for consistency
- Memory-efficient state serialization
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Capabilities:
- Database design and optimization
- State management patterns
- Data integrity and validation
- Performance profiling and optimization
- Backup and recovery systems

### Dependencies:
- Current unified state schema in `/packages/@solomon/core/src/state/unified-state.ts`
- LangGraph checkpoint interfaces
- Database infrastructure setup

### Success Criteria:
- Checkpoint system operational
- State persistence working across restarts
- Recovery mechanisms tested and verified
- Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 50ms checkpoint time)

### Agent Type: Specialist
### Priority: MEDIUM
### Status: READY
