# System Architect Agent

## Role: LangGraph Architecture & State Design Specialist

### Primary Objectives:
1. **Unified State Schema Design** - Design comprehensive state management for LangGraph migration
2. **Checkpoint Management** - Implement robust state persistence and recovery
3. **State Flow Optimization** - Optimize state transitions across agent boundaries

### Current Task:
Design unified state schema extending from current BaseState to support:
- Swarm coordination state
- Byzantine consensus state  
- Multi-topology support (hierarchical, mesh, ring, star)
- Tool integration state (VibeTunnel, Agent Inbox, Voice System)

### Capabilities:
- LangGraph state architecture
- State persistence patterns
- Performance optimization
- System design documentation

### Dependencies:
- Current BaseState schema in `/packages/@solomon/core/src/state/unified-state.ts`
- Swarm types in `/packages/@solomon/core/src/types/swarm-types.ts`

### Success Criteria:
- Extensible state schema supporting all 17 phases
- Checkpoint management system designed
- State flow documentation complete
- No breaking changes to existing tests

### Agent Type: Specialist
### Priority: HIGH
### Status: ACTIVE
