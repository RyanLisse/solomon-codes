## 🔧 Completed Actions

### 1. Console Statement Cleanup ✅

**Problem:** Console statements throughout the codebase needed to be replaced with proper structured logging for production readiness.

**Actions Taken:**
- **GitHub Auth Hook** (`src/hooks/use-github-auth.ts`)
  - ✅ Replaced `console.error()` with `logger.error()` for auth failures
  - ✅ Replaced `console.log()` with `logger.debug()` for debug information  
  - ✅ Added contextual metadata (error messages, authentication state)
  
- **VibeKit Actions** (`src/app/actions/vibekit.ts`)
  - ✅ Replaced `console.log()` with `logger.info()` for sandbox selection
  - ✅ Replaced `console.warn()` with `logger.warn()` for fallback scenarios
  - ✅ Replaced `console.error()` with `logger.error()` for operation failures
  - ✅ Added structured logging with task context and error details
  
- **Database Query Service** (`src/lib/database/query-service.ts`)
  - ✅ Replaced `console.warn()` with `logger.warn()` for slow query detection
  - ✅ Replaced `console.log()` with `logger.info()` for bulk operations
  - ✅ Replaced `console.error()` with `logger.error()` for operation failures
  - ✅ Added performance metrics and operation context

**Result:** Production-ready error tracking, debugging capabilities, and proper observability.

### 2. Logging Infrastructure Enhancement ✅

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Context-aware loggers for all modified components
- ✅ Structured logging with relevant metadata (taskId, executionTime, error context)
- ✅ Performance monitoring for database operations
- ✅ Proper error categorization and tracking

### 3. Code Quality Assessment ✅

**Comprehensive Audit Results:**
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Zero authentication/authorization issues  
- ✅ Zero performance blockers
- ✅ Proper separation of development and production code
- ✅ Mock data properly excluded from production builds

---

## 📋 Allowed Console Usage (No Action Required)

The following console usage is **intentionally allowed** for critical system functionality:

### Configuration & Startup Files
- **`/lib/config/service.ts`** - Startup logging for deployment debugging
- **`/lib/config/startup.ts`** - Application initialization status
- **`/lib/config/validation.ts`** - Environment validation results  
- **`/lib/telemetry/index.ts`** - Telemetry service bootstrap logging

**Rationale:** These files use console for critical startup debugging that must be visible even if the logging system fails to initialize.

### Development Utilities  
- **`/lib/mock/build-exclusion.ts`** - Development mock data (excluded from production)
- **`/lib/features/environment.ts`** - Environment-aware development logging
- **Test files** - Console usage in test files is acceptable
