# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will transform the solomon_codes web application into a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA). The PWA implementation will enable users to install the app on their devices, work offline with cached content, receive push notifications, and enjoy a native app-like experience. This enhancement will improve user engagement, accessibility, and provide seamless functionality across different platforms and network conditions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to install the solomon_codes app on my device, so that I can access it quickly without opening a browser and have a native app-like experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web app THEN the browser SHALL display an install prompt for supported browsers
2. WHEN a user installs the app THEN it SHALL appear in their device's app drawer/home screen with the proper icon and name
3. WHEN a user opens the installed app THEN it SHALL launch in standalone mode without browser UI elements
4. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL have a proper app icon, name, and theme color as defined in the manifest

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to work offline or with poor network connectivity, so that I can continue using core features even when my internet connection is unreliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has previously visited the app and goes offline THEN the app SHALL still load and display cached content
2. WHEN a user is offline THEN the app SHALL show appropriate offline indicators and messaging
3. WHEN a user performs actions offline THEN the app SHALL queue them for execution when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN the app detects network connectivity is restored THEN it SHALL sync any pending actions and update cached content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive push notifications from the app, so that I can stay informed about important updates, task completions, and system events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first visits the app THEN the system SHALL request permission for push notifications
2. WHEN a user grants notification permission THEN the app SHALL register for push notifications
3. WHEN relevant events occur (task completion, system updates) THEN the app SHALL send appropriate push notifications
4. WHEN a user clicks on a notification THEN the app SHALL open and navigate to the relevant content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the PWA to meet all technical requirements and best practices, so that it provides optimal performance and user experience across all supported platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PWA is audited THEN it SHALL achieve a Lighthouse PWA score of 90 or higher
2. WHEN the app loads THEN it SHALL display content within 3 seconds on 3G networks
3. WHEN the manifest is validated THEN it SHALL include all required fields (name, short_name, icons, start_url, display, theme_color, background_color)
4. WHEN the service worker is registered THEN it SHALL properly cache static assets and API responses
5. WHEN the app is tested on mobile devices THEN it SHALL be responsive and touch-friendly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to automatically update in the background, so that I always have the latest features and security updates without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new version of the app is deployed THEN the service worker SHALL detect and download the update in the background
2. WHEN an update is available THEN the app SHALL notify the user with an option to refresh and apply the update
3. WHEN a user chooses to update THEN the app SHALL seamlessly transition to the new version without data loss
4. WHEN the app updates automatically THEN it SHALL maintain user session and current state where possible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the PWA to integrate seamlessly with my device's operating system, so that it feels like a native application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is installed THEN it SHALL support device-specific features like share targets and file handling
2. WHEN a user shares content to the app THEN it SHALL properly receive and process the shared data
3. WHEN the app is running THEN it SHALL respect system theme preferences (dark/light mode)
4. WHEN the app is minimized or backgrounded THEN it SHALL maintain state and resume properly when reopened
