# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the solomon_codes web application from its current layout into a comprehensive sidebar-based interface similar to modern development tools like Terragon. The sidebar will provide navigation, task management, context engine, and various productivity features while maintaining the existing AI chat functionality as the main content area.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a collapsible sidebar navigation so that I can efficiently access different sections of the application while maximizing screen real estate for content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a collapsible sidebar on the left side of the screen
2. WHEN the user clicks the collapse/expand button THEN the sidebar SHALL animate smoothly between collapsed and expanded states
3. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed THEN the system SHALL show only icons for navigation items
4. WHEN the sidebar is expanded THEN the system SHALL show both icons and labels for navigation items
5. WHEN the sidebar state changes THEN the main content area SHALL adjust its width accordingly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want organized navigation sections in the sidebar so that I can quickly access different functional areas of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Home" section with dashboard access
2. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show an "Automations" section for browser automation features
3. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Stats" section for analytics and metrics
4. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Configure" section with "Environments" and "Settings" subsections
5. WHEN the sidebar is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a "Support" section with "Release Notes", "Documentation", "Send Feedback", and "Discord" options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an integrated task manager in the sidebar so that I can track and manage my development tasks without leaving the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar displays the task manager THEN the system SHALL show a "Tasks" section with "Active" and "Older" subsections
2. WHEN viewing active tasks THEN the system SHALL display tasks grouped by time periods (This Week, etc.)
3. WHEN a task is displayed THEN the system SHALL show task title, timestamp, repository/branch info, and status indicators
4. WHEN a task has a status THEN the system SHALL display appropriate color-coded indicators (green for success, red for failure, etc.)
5. WHEN the user clicks on a task THEN the system SHALL navigate to or display detailed task information
6. WHEN tasks are updated THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the task list without full page reload

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a context engine in the sidebar so that I can access relevant project context, files, and AI assistance based on my current work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the context engine is active THEN the system SHALL display a context panel showing current project state
2. WHEN working on a specific repository THEN the system SHALL show relevant files, recent changes, and branch information
3. WHEN the user selects context items THEN the system SHALL automatically include them in AI chat conversations
4. WHEN the context changes THEN the system SHALL update suggestions and relevant information dynamically
5. WHEN the user interacts with context items THEN the system SHALL provide quick actions like "Add to Chat", "View File", or "Open in Editor"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main content area to adapt to the sidebar so that the existing AI chat interface remains fully functional within the new layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar is present THEN the main content area SHALL occupy the remaining screen width
2. WHEN the sidebar is collapsed/expanded THEN the main content area SHALL resize smoothly without losing functionality
3. WHEN using the AI chat interface THEN all existing features SHALL work identically to the current implementation
4. WHEN the layout changes THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design principles for different screen sizes
5. WHEN on mobile devices THEN the sidebar SHALL adapt to a mobile-friendly navigation pattern

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want persistent sidebar state so that my navigation preferences are remembered across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user collapses or expands the sidebar THEN the system SHALL save this preference to local storage
2. WHEN the user returns to the application THEN the system SHALL restore the previous sidebar state
3. WHEN the user navigates between pages THEN the sidebar state SHALL remain consistent
4. WHEN the user selects a navigation item THEN the system SHALL highlight the active section
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL apply the saved sidebar preferences within 100ms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sidebar to integrate with existing authentication and theme systems so that it respects user preferences and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is not authenticated THEN the sidebar SHALL show only public navigation options
2. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the sidebar SHALL display all available navigation sections
3. WHEN the theme changes THEN the sidebar SHALL update its appearance to match the selected theme
4. WHEN using dark mode THEN the sidebar SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors and contrast
5. WHEN user permissions change THEN the sidebar SHALL update available options accordingly
