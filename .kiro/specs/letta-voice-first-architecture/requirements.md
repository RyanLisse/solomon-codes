# Letta Voice-First AI Architecture Requirements

## Introduction

This feature transforms solomon_codes into a voice-first application where all user interactions are mediated by Letta stateful AI agents. The system implements a conversational AI interface where users primarily interact through voice with persistent, memory-enabled agents that learn and evolve over time. The microphone button serves as the primary entry point for voice interactions, activating a Letta voice agent that processes speech input and provides intelligent responses through text-to-speech synthesis.

The architecture leverages Letta's advanced memory management capabilities, including self-editing memory blocks, archival memory with vector embeddings, and multi-agent orchestration to create a seamless voice-first experience that maintains context across sessions and learns from user interactions.
