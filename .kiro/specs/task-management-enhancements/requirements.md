# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the solomon_codes task management system by introducing project-based organization, git worktree execution environments, and multi-version task execution capabilities. The system will allow users to create projects that represent git repositories with their own configurations, execute coding agents in isolated worktrees, and manage multiple task versions for optimal results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage projects so that I can organize my tasks by repository and maintain separate configurations for different codebases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a "Create Project" option if no projects exist
2. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify a git repository URL or select an existing repository
3. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to provide a project name and description
4. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to configure setup scripts for dependency installation
5. WHEN creating a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to configure dev server scripts for testing changes
6. WHEN a project is created THEN the system SHALL validate the git repository access and store the project configuration
7. WHEN viewing projects THEN the system SHALL display all projects with their status, last activity, and task counts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure project-specific setup and development scripts so that coding agents can properly execute in isolated environments with all necessary dependencies and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify setup scripts (e.g., npm install, pip install requirements.txt)
2. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify dev server scripts (e.g., npm run dev, python manage.py runserver)
3. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify environment variables and configuration files
4. WHEN configuring a project THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify build and test commands
5. WHEN a project configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL validate script syntax and accessibility
6. WHEN editing project configuration THEN the system SHALL preserve existing settings and allow incremental updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks to be organized within projects so that I can manage work contextually and filter tasks by project, labels, and status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL require the user to select a project for the task
2. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL allow the user to add labels for categorization and filtering
3. WHEN viewing tasks THEN the system SHALL display tasks grouped by project with filtering options
4. WHEN filtering tasks THEN the system SHALL support filtering by project, labels, status, and date ranges
5. WHEN viewing a project THEN the system SHALL display all associated tasks with their current status
6. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL update project statistics and progress indicators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want coding agents to execute in isolated git worktrees so that each task runs in a clean environment without affecting the main repository or other concurrent tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a coding agent task is started THEN the system SHALL create a new git worktree for the task execution
2. WHEN creating a worktree THEN the system SHALL run the project's setup scripts to install dependencies and configurations
3. WHEN the worktree is ready THEN the system SHALL copy necessary environment files (.env, config files) to the worktree
4. WHEN the coding agent executes THEN the system SHALL run all operations within the isolated worktree environment
5. WHEN a task completes THEN the system SHALL preserve the worktree for review and potential merging
6. WHEN a task is archived THEN the system SHALL clean up the associated worktree to free disk space

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to generate multiple versions of task solutions so that I can compare different approaches and select the best implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a coding task THEN the system SHALL allow the user to specify the number of versions to generate (default 1, max 5)
2. WHEN generating multiple versions THEN the system SHALL create separate worktrees for each version attempt
3. WHEN versions are generated THEN the system SHALL display all versions with their differences and key characteristics
4. WHEN comparing versions THEN the system SHALL show code diffs, test results, and performance metrics
5. WHEN selecting a version THEN the system SHALL allow the user to choose the preferred implementation
6. WHEN a version is selected THEN the system SHALL mark it as the primary solution and archive alternatives

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review and test task implementations before merging so that I can ensure quality and compatibility with the existing codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is completed THEN the system SHALL provide options to review the implementation in the worktree
2. WHEN reviewing a task THEN the system SHALL allow the user to run the project's dev server to test changes
3. WHEN testing changes THEN the system SHALL display the dev server output and any error messages
4. WHEN satisfied with changes THEN the system SHALL provide options to create a pull request or merge directly
5. WHEN creating a pull request THEN the system SHALL use the task description and implementation details
6. WHEN merging changes THEN the system SHALL integrate the worktree changes into the main repository

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage project environments and dependencies so that coding agents have access to the correct tools and configurations for each project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a project THEN the system SHALL detect common project types (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.) and suggest appropriate setup scripts
2. WHEN a project uses environment variables THEN the system SHALL securely store and inject them into worktrees
3. WHEN a project has configuration files THEN the system SHALL copy them to each worktree during setup
4. WHEN dependencies change THEN the system SHALL provide options to update project setup scripts
5. WHEN setup scripts fail THEN the system SHALL display detailed error messages and suggest fixes
6. WHEN multiple projects exist THEN the system SHALL isolate their environments and prevent conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to track project progress and task analytics so that I can monitor productivity and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a project THEN the system SHALL display task completion statistics and progress over time
2. WHEN tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL track metrics like execution time, success rate, and code quality
3. WHEN multiple versions are generated THEN the system SHALL track which versions are most commonly selected
4. WHEN reviewing project history THEN the system SHALL show trends in task complexity and completion rates
5. WHEN comparing projects THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on relative productivity and success rates
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL allow users to export project and task analytics for external analysis
