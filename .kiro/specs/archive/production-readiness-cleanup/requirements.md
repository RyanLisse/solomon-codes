# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical production readiness issues in the solomon_codes application, focusing on removing hardcoded values, mock data, placeholder implementations, and development-only features that could impact production stability and security. The goal is to ensure the application is fully production-ready with proper configuration management, logging, and environment validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want all configuration values to be environment-based rather than hardcoded, so that the application can be deployed across different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load telemetry configuration from environment variables instead of hardcoded localhost:4318
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load version information from package.json or environment variables instead of hardcoded "1.0.0"
3. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which environment variables are required
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want all mock data and test fixtures removed from production builds, so that sensitive or placeholder information cannot leak into production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds for production THEN the system SHALL exclude all mock data files from the bundle
2. WHEN the application runs in production THEN the system SHALL NOT use any hardcoded test data or placeholder values
3. WHEN mock implementations are present THEN the system SHALL only use them in development/test environments
4. WHEN production APIs are called THEN the system SHALL use real implementations, not mock responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want placeholder types and disabled implementations to be properly implemented or removed, so that the codebase maintains consistency and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN placeholder types exist THEN the system SHALL either implement proper types or remove unused placeholders
2. WHEN disabled implementations are found THEN the system SHALL either restore functionality or remove dead code
3. WHEN temporary solutions are identified THEN the system SHALL implement proper solutions or document why temporary solutions are acceptable
4. WHEN code structure is maintained for disabled features THEN the system SHALL clearly document the purpose and future plans

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want development-only features to be properly gated, so that they don't accidentally run in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development features are present THEN the system SHALL check NODE_ENV before enabling them
2. WHEN debug utilities exist THEN the system SHALL only be available in development/staging environments
3. WHEN development middleware is configured THEN the system SHALL be excluded from production builds
4. WHEN development logging is enabled THEN the system SHALL use appropriate log levels for production

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TODO/FIXME comments to be addressed or properly documented, so that technical debt is managed and temporary solutions are tracked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TODO comments exist THEN the system SHALL either implement the solution or create proper issue tracking
2. WHEN FIXME comments are found THEN the system SHALL either fix the issue or document why it's acceptable
3. WHEN temporary solutions are marked THEN the system SHALL either implement permanent solutions or create migration plans
4. WHEN mock implementations have restoration comments THEN the system SHALL restore real functionality or remove the mocks

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper logging instead of console.log statements, so that production logging is structured and manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN console.log statements exist THEN the system SHALL replace them with proper logging utilities
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN the system SHALL use appropriate log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
3. WHEN structured logging is needed THEN the system SHALL include relevant context and metadata
4. WHEN production logging runs THEN the system SHALL respect log level configuration from environment variables

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want environment validation at application startup, so that configuration issues are caught early before they cause runtime failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL exit with clear error messages
3. WHEN optional environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use documented default values
4. WHEN environment variables have invalid formats THEN the system SHALL provide specific validation error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Stagehand API integration to be properly implemented, so that browser automation features work correctly in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stagehand API is called THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and configuration
2. WHEN browser automation is requested THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully with proper fallbacks
3. WHEN Stagehand operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users
4. WHEN Stagehand is unavailable THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully without breaking core functionality
