# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements OAuth authentication using Claude Max subscriptions, allowing users to authenticate with their existing Claude Pro/Max accounts or use API keys as an alternative. The implementation provides a simple button interface that handles the OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for secure authentication without requiring users to manage separate API keys.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user with a Claude Max subscription, I want to sign in with my existing Claude account, so that I can access the application without creating separate API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Sign in with Claude Max" THEN the system SHALL initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE
2. WHEN the OAuth flow is initiated THEN the system SHALL generate a secure authorization URL with proper PKCE challenge
3. WHEN the user completes authorization THEN the system SHALL exchange the authorization code for access and refresh tokens
4. WHEN tokens are received THEN the system SHALL store them securely with proper encryption
5. WHEN the user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL display their authentication status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user without Claude Max, I want to use my API keys for authentication, so that I can still access the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects API key authentication THEN the system SHALL provide a secure input field for the API key
2. WHEN an API key is entered THEN the system SHALL validate the key format and functionality
3. WHEN the API key is valid THEN the system SHALL store it securely
4. WHEN using API key authentication THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this authentication method

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my tokens to be automatically refreshed, so that I don't have to re-authenticate frequently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an access token is about to expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it using the refresh token
2. WHEN token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to re-authenticate
3. WHEN tokens are refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the stored tokens securely
4. IF a token expires within 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL proactively refresh it

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely log out, so that my authentication credentials are properly cleared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks logout THEN the system SHALL clear all stored tokens and credentials
2. WHEN logout is complete THEN the system SHALL redirect to the unauthenticated state
3. WHEN tokens are cleared THEN the system SHALL ensure no sensitive data remains in storage
4. WHEN logged out THEN the system SHALL revoke tokens on the server side if possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling for authentication failures, so that users receive clear feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth authorization fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
2. WHEN token exchange fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error information
3. WHEN API key validation fails THEN the system SHALL indicate the specific issue
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle re-authentication

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication data to be stored securely, so that my credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL use encrypted storage mechanisms
2. WHEN in a browser environment THEN the system SHALL use secure storage APIs
3. WHEN tokens are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS only
4. WHEN PKCE is used THEN the system SHALL generate cryptographically secure challenges
5. IF storage is compromised THEN the system SHALL minimize exposure through encryption

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a simple and intuitive authentication interface, so that I can easily choose my preferred authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the authentication page THEN the system SHALL display clear options for both OAuth and API key methods
2. WHEN using OAuth THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for the authorization flow
3. WHEN entering an API key THEN the system SHALL provide helpful formatting guidance
4. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
5. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback
