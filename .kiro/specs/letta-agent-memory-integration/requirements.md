# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves integrating Letta (the AI operating system for stateful agents) into the solomon_codes application to provide advanced agent memory management capabilities. Letta will enable the creation of stateful AI agents that can maintain persistent memory, learn from interactions, and provide more contextual and personalized assistance. The integration will leverage Letta's self-editing memory architecture, multi-agent systems, and tool calling capabilities to enhance the existing AI-powered features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Letta for stateful agent memory, so that AI agents can maintain persistent context and learn from previous interactions across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Letta is integrated THEN the application SHALL support stateful AI agents with persistent memory
2. WHEN agents interact with users THEN they SHALL maintain context across multiple conversations
3. WHEN agents are created THEN they SHALL have configurable memory blocks for persona, human context, and project information
4. WHEN the application restarts THEN agent memory SHALL persist and be available for continued interactions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI agents to remember my preferences and project context, so that I receive more personalized and relevant assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I interact with an agent THEN it SHALL remember my name, preferences, and coding style
2. WHEN I work on different projects THEN agents SHALL maintain separate context for each project
3. WHEN I ask follow-up questions THEN agents SHALL reference previous conversations and decisions
4. WHEN agents provide suggestions THEN they SHALL be tailored to my specific project requirements and history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create specialized agents for different tasks, so that I can have domain-specific AI assistance for various development activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating agents THEN I SHALL be able to define specialized personas for different development tasks
2. WHEN agents are configured THEN they SHALL have access to relevant tools for their specific domain
3. WHEN multiple agents exist THEN they SHALL be able to communicate and share relevant information
4. WHEN agents are deployed THEN they SHALL maintain their specialized knowledge and capabilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to have access to web search and code execution capabilities, so that they can provide comprehensive assistance with real-time information and code validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need current information THEN they SHALL be able to search the web using built-in tools
2. WHEN agents work with code THEN they SHALL be able to execute and validate code in a sandboxed environment
3. WHEN agents provide solutions THEN they SHALL be able to test and verify their recommendations
4. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN they SHALL be able to debug and provide corrected solutions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate Letta with the existing database and task management system, so that agents can access and update project information seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents access project data THEN they SHALL be able to read from the existing database schema
2. WHEN agents create or update tasks THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the task management system
3. WHEN agents work with environments THEN they SHALL have access to GitHub integration and repository information
4. WHEN agents make changes THEN they SHALL follow the existing data validation and security patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Letta for both development and production environments, so that I can test agent functionality locally and deploy it reliably to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN I SHALL be able to use self-hosted Letta or Letta Cloud for testing
2. WHEN deploying to production THEN Letta SHALL be configured with appropriate security and performance settings
3. WHEN switching environments THEN agent configurations SHALL be environment-specific
4. WHEN monitoring agents THEN I SHALL have visibility into agent performance and memory usage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with Letta agents through the existing chat interface, so that I can access enhanced AI capabilities without learning new interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat interface THEN I SHALL be able to interact with Letta agents seamlessly
2. WHEN agents respond THEN the responses SHALL be displayed in the existing chat UI
3. WHEN agents use tools THEN the tool execution SHALL be visible and trackable in the interface
4. WHEN agents access memory THEN the memory updates SHALL be transparent to the user experience

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and monitoring for Letta integration, so that I can ensure agent reliability and performance in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are deployed THEN they SHALL have comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. WHEN agents interact THEN their performance SHALL be monitored and logged
3. WHEN agents encounter errors THEN the errors SHALL be captured and reported appropriately
4. WHEN agents use memory THEN memory operations SHALL be validated and tested for consistency
