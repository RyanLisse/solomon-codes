# Letta Stateful AI Agents Integration Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements stateful AI agents using Letta (formerly MemGPT) integrated with Supabase PostgreSQL for persistent memory storage in solomon_codes. The system will enable AI agents that maintain memory and context across long-running conversations, learn from interactions, and evolve over time without starting from scratch. Letta agents will have persistent memory blocks, archival memory, and the ability to manage their own context through self-editing memory tools.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Letta Agent Creation and Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create and manage stateful AI agents using Letta, so that I can build AI systems that maintain memory and context across conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new agent THEN the system SHALL initialize a Letta agent with memory blocks (persona, human, custom blocks)
2. WHEN an agent is created THEN the system SHALL store all agent state in Supabase PostgreSQL database
3. WHEN managing agents THEN the system SHALL provide CRUD operations for agent creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion
4. WHEN agents are listed THEN the system SHALL display agent metadata, memory status, and conversation history

### Requirement 2: Persistent Memory Block Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI agents to remember information about me and our conversations, so that interactions become more personalized and contextual over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent is created THEN the system SHALL initialize core memory blocks (persona, human) with appropriate descriptions
2. WHEN memory blocks are updated THEN the system SHALL persist changes to Supabase with vector embeddings for semantic search
3. WHEN custom memory blocks are created THEN the system SHALL allow structured storage of domain-specific information
4. WHEN memory blocks are queried THEN the system SHALL provide fast retrieval and semantic search capabilities using pgvector

### Requirement 3: Archival Memory and Long-term Storage

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to store and retrieve long-term memories beyond my context window, so that I can maintain comprehensive knowledge about users and conversations over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conversation history exceeds context limits THEN the system SHALL store messages in archival memory with vector embeddings
2. WHEN agents need to recall information THEN the system SHALL provide semantic search across archival memory using vector similarity
3. WHEN archival memory is queried THEN the system SHALL return relevant memories ranked by semantic similarity and recency
4. WHEN memory becomes stale THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for memory summarization and archival

### Requirement 4: Agent-to-Agent Communication

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want multiple AI agents to communicate and collaborate, so that I can build complex multi-agent workflows and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to communicate THEN the system SHALL provide message passing between agents with proper routing
2. WHEN multi-agent workflows are executed THEN the system SHALL coordinate agent interactions and maintain conversation context
3. WHEN agents share information THEN the system SHALL enable shared memory blocks and collaborative knowledge building
4. WHEN agent communication occurs THEN the system SHALL log interactions for debugging and workflow optimization

### Requirement 5: Self-Editing Memory Tools

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want to manage my own memory through built-in tools, so that I can update my understanding and knowledge autonomously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to update memory THEN the system SHALL provide memory editing tools (core_memory_append, core_memory_replace)
2. WHEN memory tools are used THEN the system SHALL validate changes and update Supabase storage with proper versioning
3. WHEN memory conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide conflict resolution mechanisms and rollback capabilities
4. WHEN memory tools are executed THEN the system SHALL log all memory modifications for audit and debugging purposes

### Requirement 6: Integration with VibeKit Execution System

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want Letta agents to integrate with the existing VibeKit execution system, so that agents can execute code and perform actions while maintaining memory context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents execute code through VibeKit THEN the system SHALL maintain agent memory context throughout execution
2. WHEN VibeKit operations complete THEN the system SHALL update agent memory with execution results and learnings
3. WHEN agents need to perform actions THEN they SHALL access VibeKit tools while preserving conversational state
4. WHEN execution context is needed THEN agents SHALL provide relevant memory context to enhance VibeKit operations

### Requirement 7: Agent Dashboard and Memory Visualization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want visual dashboards to monitor agent memory, conversations, and system state, so that I can understand and debug agent behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the agent dashboard THEN users SHALL see agent memory blocks, conversation history, and system status
2. WHEN viewing agent memory THEN users SHALL see structured memory blocks with semantic relationships and update history
3. WHEN monitoring conversations THEN users SHALL access real-time conversation flows and agent reasoning steps
4. WHEN debugging agents THEN users SHALL have access to memory modification logs and agent decision traces

### Requirement 8: Security and Data Privacy

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want agent memory and conversations to maintain security standards and privacy requirements, so that sensitive user data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing agent memory THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using Supabase security features
2. WHEN accessing agent data THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls and user isolation
3. WHEN agents process sensitive information THEN the system SHALL provide data sanitization and privacy controls
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs of all agent memory modifications and access
