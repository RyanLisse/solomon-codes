## üìà Progress Tracking

This summary should be updated regularly as specs are completed. Each spec should maintain its own task completion status, and this summary should reflect the aggregate progress across all specs.

## üìÅ Archive Location

Completed specs have been moved to `.kiro/specs/archive/` and include:
- `production-readiness-cleanup/`
- `winston-logging-integration/`
- `security-data-management-assessment/`
- `claude-max-oauth/`
- `comprehensive-sidebar-layout/`

These can be referenced for implementation details but are considered complete.

**Last Updated**: After archiving completed specs and streamlining active ones
**Next Review**: After completion of current high-priority PWA and testing tasks
