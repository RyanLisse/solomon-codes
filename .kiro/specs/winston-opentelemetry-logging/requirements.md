# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds comprehensive logging capabilities to the solomon_codes web application using Winston as the primary logging library, optimized with OpenTelemetry for observability and distributed tracing. The implementation will provide structured logging, telemetry data collection, and seamless integration with the existing Next.js application architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structured logging throughout the application, so that I can effectively debug issues and monitor application behavior in development and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN Winston logger SHALL be initialized with appropriate configuration for the current environment
2. WHEN a log entry is created THEN the system SHALL include structured metadata including timestamp, level, service name, and request context
3. WHEN running in development THEN logs SHALL be output to console with human-readable formatting
4. WHEN running in production THEN logs SHALL be output in JSON format for log aggregation systems
5. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with full stack trace and contextual information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want OpenTelemetry integration with logging, so that I can correlate logs with traces and metrics for comprehensive observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenTelemetry is configured THEN Winston SHALL automatically include trace and span IDs in log entries
2. WHEN a request is processed THEN logs SHALL be correlated with the active trace context
3. WHEN telemetry data is collected THEN the system SHALL export traces and metrics to configured endpoints
4. IF OpenTelemetry instrumentation is active THEN automatic instrumentation SHALL be applied to HTTP requests, database operations, and external API calls
5. WHEN logs are generated THEN they SHALL include service metadata consistent with OpenTelemetry resource attributes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable log levels and outputs, so that I can control logging verbosity and direct logs to appropriate destinations based on environment needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN log level SHALL be configurable via environment variables
2. WHEN in development environment THEN default log level SHALL be 'debug'
3. WHEN in production environment THEN default log level SHALL be 'info'
4. IF LOG_LEVEL environment variable is set THEN the system SHALL use the specified log level
5. WHEN logs are written THEN they SHALL support multiple transports (console, file, external services)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want logging utilities integrated with the existing application structure, so that I can easily add logging to components, API routes, and server actions without complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing the logger THEN it SHALL be available as a simple ES module import
2. WHEN logging from API routes THEN the logger SHALL automatically include request metadata
3. WHEN logging from server actions THEN the logger SHALL include action context and user information
4. IF an unhandled error occurs THEN the system SHALL automatically log the error with full context
5. WHEN using the logger THEN it SHALL provide TypeScript types for log levels and metadata

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance monitoring through logging, so that I can identify slow operations and optimize application performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request duration and response status
2. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL log query execution time
3. WHEN external API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log response times and status codes
4. IF an operation exceeds performance thresholds THEN the system SHALL log a warning with timing details
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be compatible with OpenTelemetry metrics format
