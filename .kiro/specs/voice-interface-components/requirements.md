# Voice Interface Components Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the user interface components required for voice-first interaction in solomon_codes, with particular focus on the microphone button functionality and voice interaction flow. These components serve as the primary interface between users and Letta voice agents, providing intuitive voice input/output capabilities with visual feedback and accessibility features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Microphone Button Component

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clearly visible and accessible microphone button, so that I can easily activate voice input and see the current recording state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the microphone button is displayed THEN it SHALL be prominently positioned and easily identifiable
2. WHEN the button is clicked THEN it SHALL toggle between recording and idle states
3. WHEN recording is active THEN the button SHALL provide visual feedback (pulsing animation, color change)
4. WHEN processing speech THEN the button SHALL show a processing state with appropriate visual indicators
5. WHEN microphone access is denied THEN the button SHALL display an error state with helpful messaging
6. WHEN the button is focused THEN it SHALL be accessible via keyboard navigation and screen readers

### Requirement 2: Voice Visualization and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual feedback during voice interactions, so that I understand when the system is listening, processing, and responding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice recording starts THEN the interface SHALL show a recording indicator with audio level visualization
2. WHEN speech is being transcribed THEN the interface SHALL display real-time transcription text
3. WHEN the agent is processing THEN the interface SHALL show thinking/processing indicators
4. WHEN the agent responds THEN the interface SHALL display the response text while playing audio
5. WHEN voice processing encounters errors THEN the interface SHALL show clear error messages with recovery options

### Requirement 3: Speech Recognition Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust speech recognition functionality, so that user voice input is accurately converted to text for Letta agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN speech recognition is activated THEN it SHALL use the Web Speech API with appropriate fallbacks
2. WHEN users speak THEN the system SHALL provide real-time interim results and final transcription
3. WHEN speech recognition fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and provide user feedback
4. WHEN multiple languages are detected THEN the system SHALL adapt recognition settings accordingly
5. WHEN background noise is present THEN the system SHALL attempt noise reduction and filtering

### Requirement 4: Text-to-Speech Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want natural-sounding voice responses from AI agents, so that conversations feel natural and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents provide text responses THEN the system SHALL convert them to natural-sounding speech
2. WHEN speech synthesis occurs THEN users SHALL be able to control playback (pause, stop, adjust speed)
3. WHEN multiple voices are available THEN users SHALL be able to select their preferred voice
4. WHEN speech synthesis fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to text display with error notification
5. WHEN long responses are generated THEN the system SHALL support streaming audio playback

### Requirement 5: Voice Interaction Flow

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth voice interaction workflows, so that I can have natural conversations with AI agents without technical interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click the microphone button THEN voice recording SHALL start immediately with visual confirmation
2. WHEN I finish speaking THEN the system SHALL automatically detect speech end and process the input
3. WHEN transcription is complete THEN it SHALL be sent to the appropriate Letta agent automatically
4. WHEN the agent responds THEN the response SHALL be played back immediately with text display
5. WHEN I want to interrupt THEN I SHALL be able to stop playback and start a new voice input

### Requirement 6: Accessibility and Usability

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want voice interface components to be fully accessible, so that I can use voice features regardless of my abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all voice controls SHALL be accessible via keyboard shortcuts
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all voice interface states SHALL be properly announced
3. WHEN visual indicators are shown THEN they SHALL have sufficient color contrast and alternative text
4. WHEN voice features are unavailable THEN alternative text input methods SHALL remain accessible
5. WHEN users have hearing impairments THEN visual transcription SHALL be prominently displayed

### Requirement 7: Integration with Existing UI

**User Story:** As a developer, I want voice interface components to integrate seamlessly with the existing solomon_codes UI, so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice components are added THEN they SHALL follow existing design system patterns and styling
2. WHEN voice features are active THEN they SHALL not interfere with existing chat interface functionality
3. WHEN switching between text and voice input THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and intuitive
4. WHEN voice components are displayed THEN they SHALL be responsive across different screen sizes
5. WHEN voice features are disabled THEN the interface SHALL gracefully fall back to text-only mode

### Requirement 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice interactions to be fast and responsive, so that conversations feel natural and real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice recording starts THEN the response time SHALL be less than 100ms
2. WHEN speech is processed THEN transcription SHALL begin within 500ms of speech completion
3. WHEN agents respond THEN audio playback SHALL start within 1 second of response generation
4. WHEN multiple voice interactions occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent requests appropriately
5. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and fallbacks

## Component Specifications

### MicrophoneButton Component

```typescript
interface MicrophoneButtonProps {
  onStartRecording: () => void;
  onStopRecording: () => void;
  onError: (error: VoiceError) => void;
  isRecording: boolean;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  isDisabled: boolean;
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  variant?: 'default' | 'outline' | 'ghost';
  className?: string;
}

enum VoiceState {
  IDLE = 'idle',
  RECORDING = 'recording',
  PROCESSING = 'processing',
  SPEAKING = 'speaking',
  ERROR = 'error'
}
```

### VoiceVisualization Component

```typescript
interface VoiceVisualizationProps {
  isRecording: boolean;
  audioLevel: number;
  transcription: string;
  isInterim: boolean;
  error?: VoiceError;
}
```

### VoiceControls Component

```typescript
interface VoiceControlsProps {
  onVolumeChange: (volume: number) => void;
  onRateChange: (rate: number) => void;
  onVoiceChange: (voiceId: string) => void;
  onLanguageChange: (language: string) => void;
  currentSettings: VoiceSettings;
  availableVoices: SpeechSynthesisVoice[];
}
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Browser Compatibility
- Web Speech API support required (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers
- Polyfills for older browser versions where possible

### Security Considerations
- Microphone permission handling and user consent
- Secure transmission of voice data to Letta agents
- Privacy controls for voice data retention

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient audio processing and compression
- Lazy loading of voice synthesis voices
- Caching of frequently used voice responses

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error states and recovery mechanisms
- User-friendly error messages and guidance
- Fallback to text input when voice features fail
