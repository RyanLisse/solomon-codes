# Security Data Management Assessment Requirements

## Introduction

This assessment evaluates the current security posture of solomon_codes regarding user data management, API key handling, and sensitive information protection. The goal is to document existing security measures and identify areas for improvement to ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Key Security Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all API keys to be securely stored and validated, so that unauthorized access to external services is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is configured THEN the system SHALL validate the key format using predefined patterns
2. WHEN API keys are logged THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive values showing only first 4 and last 4 characters
3. WHEN API keys are stored in environment variables THEN the system SHALL use secure configuration validation
4. WHEN API keys are accessed THEN the system SHALL use a centralized secure configuration service
5. WHEN invalid API keys are detected THEN the system SHALL throw security configuration errors

### Requirement 2: User Authentication Token Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication tokens to be securely stored and encrypted, so that my account access remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication tokens are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption
2. WHEN tokens are retrieved THEN the system SHALL decrypt them securely and validate expiration
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically clear them with a 5-minute buffer
4. WHEN encryption fails THEN the system SHALL clear corrupted data and require re-authentication
5. WHEN tokens are logged THEN the system SHALL only log metadata without sensitive token values

### Requirement 3: Sensitive Data Sanitization

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want all sensitive data to be automatically sanitized in logs and outputs, so that credentials and personal information are not exposed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging metadata THEN the system SHALL sanitize sensitive keys including passwords, tokens, secrets, and API keys
2. WHEN sensitive data is detected THEN the system SHALL replace values with "[REDACTED]" placeholder
3. WHEN nested objects contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL recursively sanitize all levels
4. WHEN user context is logged THEN the system SHALL include only non-sensitive identifiers
5. WHEN database operations are logged THEN the system SHALL truncate long queries and sanitize parameters

### Requirement 4: Database Security and User Data Storage

**User Story:** As a data protection officer, I want user data to be stored securely with proper access controls, so that personal information is protected according to privacy regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is stored THEN the system SHALL use PostgreSQL with proper indexing and constraints
2. WHEN sensitive user information is stored THEN the system SHALL not store passwords or raw authentication credentials
3. WHEN user sessions are tracked THEN the system SHALL use secure session identifiers and correlation IDs
4. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log access with proper audit trails
5. WHEN user data is deleted THEN the system SHALL use cascade deletion for related records

### Requirement 5: Environment-Based Security Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want security configurations to be environment-specific, so that production systems have stricter security controls than development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL require all critical API keys and enforce strict validation
2. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL allow optional API keys for testing purposes
3. WHEN environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent application startup with clear error messages
4. WHEN production environment uses localhost URLs THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration
5. WHEN telemetry is configured in production THEN the system SHALL require proper endpoint configuration

### Requirement 6: OAuth and Third-Party Integration Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my OAuth integrations to be secure and follow industry standards, so that my third-party account access is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OAuth flow is initiated THEN the system SHALL use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for security
2. WHEN OAuth state is generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random values
3. WHEN OAuth callbacks are processed THEN the system SHALL validate state parameters to prevent CSRF attacks
4. WHEN OAuth tokens are exchanged THEN the system SHALL validate authorization codes and handle errors gracefully
5. WHEN OAuth errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details

### Requirement 7: Observability and Security Monitoring

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want comprehensive security event logging and monitoring, so that potential security incidents can be detected and investigated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log them with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN authentication attempts are made THEN the system SHALL track success and failure events
3. WHEN API access occurs THEN the system SHALL log requests with sanitized metadata
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture stack traces without exposing sensitive configuration
5. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive operational data

### Requirement 8: Data Retention and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want automated data retention and cleanup policies, so that sensitive data is not retained longer than necessary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent memory is stored THEN the system SHALL support expiration timestamps for automatic cleanup
2. WHEN execution snapshots are created THEN the system SHALL limit retention based on configured policies
3. WHEN observability events are logged THEN the system SHALL implement time-based retention
4. WHEN user sessions end THEN the system SHALL clean up associated temporary data
5. WHEN data cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL log cleanup operations for audit purposes
