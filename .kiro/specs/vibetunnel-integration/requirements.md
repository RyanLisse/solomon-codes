# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates VibeTunnel (https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel) into the solomon_codes application to enable users to run the application locally while providing secure remote access through tunneling. VibeTunnel is a modern tunneling solution that allows developers to expose local development servers to the internet securely, similar to ngrok but with enhanced features for AI and development workflows.

The integration will provide users with a seamless way to:
- Run solomon_codes locally for development
- Share their local instance with team members or clients
- Access the application from different devices/locations
- Maintain security while exposing local services

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start a VibeTunnel connection alongside my local solomon_codes development server, so that I can share my local instance with others remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs a development command THEN the system SHALL automatically start VibeTunnel alongside the Next.js development server
2. WHEN VibeTunnel starts successfully THEN the system SHALL display the public tunnel URL in the console
3. WHEN the tunnel is established THEN the system SHALL ensure the remote URL properly routes to the local development server
4. IF VibeTunnel fails to start THEN the system SHALL continue running the local development server and display an appropriate warning message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure VibeTunnel settings through environment variables, so that I can customize the tunneling behavior for my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sets VIBETUNNEL_ENABLED environment variable to true THEN the system SHALL enable VibeTunnel integration
2. WHEN the user provides VIBETUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN THEN the system SHALL use the specified subdomain for the tunnel
3. WHEN the user provides VIBETUNNEL_AUTH_TOKEN THEN the system SHALL authenticate with VibeTunnel using the provided token
4. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for anonymous tunneling
5. WHEN invalid configuration is detected THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages and fallback gracefully

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VibeTunnel to integrate seamlessly with the existing development workflow, so that I don't need to change my current development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `bun dev` THEN the system SHALL optionally start VibeTunnel based on configuration
2. WHEN I run `bun dev:web` THEN the system SHALL start VibeTunnel only for the web application
3. WHEN the development server stops THEN the system SHALL automatically terminate the VibeTunnel connection
4. WHEN I use Turbopack or other development features THEN VibeTunnel SHALL work seamlessly with all existing functionality
5. WHEN hot reloading occurs THEN the tunnel SHALL remain stable and functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see VibeTunnel status and connection information in the development console, so that I can monitor the tunnel connection and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VibeTunnel starts THEN the system SHALL display the tunnel status with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN the tunnel URL is available THEN the system SHALL display it prominently with copy-to-clipboard functionality
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages and troubleshooting tips
4. WHEN the tunnel disconnects THEN the system SHALL show reconnection attempts and status updates
5. WHEN multiple services are running THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which services are tunneled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VibeTunnel to work with both the web application and documentation site, so that I can share both parts of the project remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the full development stack THEN the system SHALL create tunnels for both web app (port 3001) and docs site
2. WHEN running individual applications THEN the system SHALL create tunnels only for the active services
3. WHEN multiple tunnels are active THEN the system SHALL display all tunnel URLs with clear service labels
4. WHEN services restart THEN the system SHALL maintain tunnel connections or re-establish them automatically
5. WHEN port conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and provide alternative solutions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VibeTunnel integration to be optional and easily disabled, so that I can choose when to use tunneling without affecting my normal development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VIBETUNNEL_ENABLED is false or unset THEN the system SHALL run normally without any tunneling functionality
2. WHEN VibeTunnel is disabled THEN the system SHALL not attempt to install or configure VibeTunnel dependencies
3. WHEN switching between enabled/disabled states THEN the system SHALL require no additional configuration changes
4. WHEN VibeTunnel is disabled THEN the system SHALL show no VibeTunnel-related output or warnings
5. WHEN documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL clearly explain how to enable/disable VibeTunnel integration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VibeTunnel to handle authentication and security properly, so that my local development environment remains secure while being accessible remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using authenticated tunnels THEN the system SHALL securely store and use authentication tokens
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to anonymous tunneling with appropriate warnings
3. WHEN security features are available THEN the system SHALL enable them by default (e.g., password protection, IP restrictions)
4. WHEN sensitive environment variables are present THEN the system SHALL ensure they are not exposed through the tunnel
5. WHEN the tunnel is active THEN the system SHALL display security status and recommendations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation and setup instructions for VibeTunnel integration, so that I can quickly understand and configure the feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing project documentation THEN it SHALL include comprehensive VibeTunnel setup instructions
2. WHEN configuration options are available THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with examples
3. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the documentation SHALL provide common solutions and debugging steps
4. WHEN security considerations apply THEN they SHALL be prominently documented with best practices
5. WHEN integration examples are provided THEN they SHALL cover common development scenarios and use cases
