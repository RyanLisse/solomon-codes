# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive migration of Solomon Codes from its current multi-agent architecture to a unified LangGraph-based swarm architecture. The migration introduces a Queen AI with worker agents, dynamic topology management, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) London School methodology. This transformation will unify Solomon Codes and Claude Flow features into a single, scalable, and maintainable system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core LangGraph Foundation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want a unified LangGraph-based foundation, so that all agent interactions can be managed through a single, consistent state management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a unified state schema that combines all existing agent states
2. WHEN agents interact THEN the system SHALL use LangGraph state transitions for all communications
3. WHEN state changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all distributed components
4. IF state synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL implement optimistic locking and CRDT patterns
5. WHEN the foundation is complete THEN it SHALL support at least 80% test coverage with TDD London School methodology

### Requirement 2: Swarm Coordination Architecture

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want a swarm-based coordination system with a Queen AI, so that complex development tasks can be dynamically distributed and managed across specialized worker agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is submitted THEN the SwarmCoordinator SHALL analyze task requirements and spawn appropriate worker agents
2. WHEN resource limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle constraints gracefully without task failure
3. WHEN agents need to make decisions THEN the ConsensusEngine SHALL collect votes and calculate consensus with Byzantine fault tolerance
4. WHEN topology changes are needed THEN the TopologyManager SHALL support hierarchical, mesh, ring, and star patterns
5. WHEN the Queen Agent operates THEN it SHALL record all decisions and maintain swarm state consistency

### Requirement 3: Agent Migration and Transformation

**User Story:** As a developer using the system, I want existing agent functionality preserved during migration, so that no features are lost while gaining the benefits of the new architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Manager Agent is migrated THEN it SHALL become the Queen Agent Coordinator with enhanced capabilities
2. WHEN Planner Agent is migrated THEN it SHALL become a Strategic Worker with LangGraph integration
3. WHEN Programmer Agent is migrated THEN it SHALL become an Implementation Worker with coding, debugging, and refactoring capabilities
4. WHEN Reviewer Agent is migrated THEN it SHALL become a Quality Worker with comprehensive review capabilities
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved with feature parity

### Requirement 4: VibeTunnel and Agent Inbox Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want seamless browser-based terminal access and message queuing, so that I can interact with agents in real-time and ensure reliable message delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VibeTunnel is integrated THEN it SHALL provide browser-based terminal access with secure WebSocket connections
2. WHEN commands are executed THEN the system SHALL support real-time execution with proper authentication
3. WHEN Agent Inbox is implemented THEN it SHALL provide message queuing with priority-based routing
4. WHEN message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL handle dead letters and provide message persistence
5. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL route messages efficiently through the inbox system

### Requirement 5: Voice System Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want voice-first interaction capabilities, so that I can communicate with agents naturally through speech and receive audio responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN voice commands are received THEN the system SHALL process audio buffers and convert them to actionable commands
2. WHEN text responses are generated THEN the system SHALL synthesize speech for audio output
3. WHEN voice agents are needed THEN the system SHALL route commands to appropriate voice-capable agents
4. WHEN voice processing occurs THEN it SHALL integrate seamlessly with the swarm coordination system
5. WHEN voice features are active THEN they SHALL maintain real-time performance standards

### Requirement 6: Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage with TDD methodology, so that the migrated system is reliable, maintainable, and performs better than the current implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL follow TDD London School (mockist) approach with test doubles for all dependencies
2. WHEN code coverage is measured THEN it SHALL achieve minimum 80% coverage for branches, functions, lines, and statements
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL cover all critical user workflows and external system integrations
4. WHEN performance tests execute THEN they SHALL verify swarm scalability and meet baseline performance metrics
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN it SHALL achieve 100% pass rate before migration completion

### Requirement 7: VibeKit Sandbox Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated sandbox capabilities, so that I can manage workspaces, deploy code, and develop in browser-based environments seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN workspaces are needed THEN the system SHALL integrate with Daytona for workspace management
2. WHEN code deployment occurs THEN the system SHALL support Cloudflare Workers deployment
3. WHEN browser development is required THEN the system SHALL open workspaces in browser environments
4. WHEN sandbox operations execute THEN they SHALL integrate with the swarm coordination system
5. WHEN VibeKit features are used THEN they SHALL maintain security and performance standards

### Requirement 8: Migration Safety and Rollback

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want safe migration procedures with rollback capabilities, so that the system can be restored if issues occur during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration phases execute THEN each phase SHALL have clear success criteria and validation checkpoints
2. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL support rollback to the previous stable state
3. WHEN feature parity is tested THEN comprehensive mapping SHALL ensure no functionality is lost
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN benchmarks SHALL meet or exceed current system baseline
5. WHEN migration completes THEN all external integrations SHALL function correctly with adapter patterns

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a team member, I want comprehensive documentation and clear migration procedures, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend the new system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is created THEN it SHALL cover architecture, API references, and operational procedures
2. WHEN migration procedures are documented THEN they SHALL include step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting guides
3. WHEN code is written THEN it SHALL include comprehensive inline documentation and examples
4. WHEN the system is deployed THEN operational runbooks SHALL be available for maintenance and monitoring
5. WHEN knowledge transfer occurs THEN team members SHALL be trained on the new architecture and tools

### Requirement 10: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the migrated system to perform better than the current implementation, so that development workflows are faster and more efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN swarm coordination occurs THEN it SHALL minimize network latency through local caching and batch messaging
2. WHEN agents communicate THEN the system SHALL handle Byzantine failures with fault-tolerant consensus
3. WHEN load increases THEN the system SHALL scale horizontally with additional worker agents
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN response times SHALL be equal to or better than the current system
5. WHEN resource utilization is monitored THEN the system SHALL optimize memory and CPU usage efficiently
