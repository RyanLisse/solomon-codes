# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the solomon_codes application from NeonDB to Supabase as the primary PostgreSQL database provider while maintaining Electric SQL integration for real-time synchronization capabilities. The migration will leverage Supabase's robust PostgreSQL hosting, built-in authentication, real-time subscriptions, and edge functions while preserving the existing Electric SQL architecture for local-first data synchronization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from NeonDB to Supabase, so that I can leverage Supabase's comprehensive backend-as-a-service features while maintaining Electric SQL's real-time sync capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL use Supabase as the primary PostgreSQL database provider
2. WHEN Electric SQL synchronization occurs THEN it SHALL work seamlessly with the Supabase PostgreSQL instance
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase instead of NeonDB without any functionality loss
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL execute against the Supabase database with the same performance characteristics

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain all existing database schemas and data, so that the migration is transparent to end users and doesn't cause data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration occurs THEN all existing database schemas SHALL be preserved in Supabase
2. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all existing data SHALL be transferred to Supabase without corruption
3. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL return the same results as before the migration
4. WHEN the application accesses database tables THEN all relationships and constraints SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Electric SQL to work with Supabase, so that real-time synchronization continues to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Electric SQL is configured THEN it SHALL connect to the Supabase PostgreSQL instance
2. WHEN real-time sync occurs THEN Electric SQL SHALL replicate data changes from Supabase
3. WHEN local PGlite instances sync THEN they SHALL receive updates from the Supabase database
4. WHEN conflicts occur during sync THEN Electric SQL SHALL resolve them using the configured conflict resolution strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all database connection configurations, so that the application uses Supabase connection strings and credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN they SHALL include Supabase database URL and credentials
2. WHEN the Drizzle ORM connects THEN it SHALL use the Supabase connection string
3. WHEN Electric SQL initializes THEN it SHALL use the Supabase database configuration
4. WHEN connection pooling is used THEN it SHALL be optimized for Supabase's connection limits

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage Supabase's additional features, so that I can enhance the application with built-in authentication, real-time subscriptions, and edge functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase client is configured THEN it SHALL provide access to authentication services
2. WHEN real-time features are needed THEN the application SHALL be able to use Supabase's real-time subscriptions
3. WHEN edge computing is required THEN the application SHALL be able to utilize Supabase Edge Functions
4. WHEN file storage is needed THEN the application SHALL have access to Supabase Storage

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain development and production environment separation, so that I can test the migration safely before deploying to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development environment is configured THEN it SHALL use a separate Supabase project
2. WHEN production deployment occurs THEN it SHALL use the production Supabase project
3. WHEN environment variables are set THEN they SHALL clearly distinguish between development and production
4. WHEN testing occurs THEN it SHALL not affect production data or configurations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure zero-downtime migration, so that users experience no service interruption during the database transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration planning occurs THEN it SHALL include a rollback strategy
2. WHEN data migration happens THEN it SHALL be performed during low-traffic periods
3. WHEN the cutover occurs THEN it SHALL be completed within the maintenance window
4. WHEN issues arise THEN the system SHALL be able to rollback to NeonDB quickly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update all documentation and configuration files, so that future development and deployment processes reference Supabase instead of NeonDB.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect Supabase as the database provider
2. WHEN deployment scripts are modified THEN they SHALL use Supabase connection parameters
3. WHEN environment examples are provided THEN they SHALL show Supabase configuration format
4. WHEN troubleshooting guides are updated THEN they SHALL include Supabase-specific debugging steps
