# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates containerized worktrees into solomon_codes, combining Git worktrees, Dagger containerization, and VibeTunnel remote access to create isolated development environments. Each worktree provides a dedicated Git branch, containerized runtime environment, and complete development history tracking.

The integration leverages:
- **Git Worktrees**: Isolated branch workspaces with dedicated file systems
- **Dagger**: Containerized development environments with reproducible builds
- **VibeTunnel**: Remote access to containerized development servers
- **History Tracking**: Complete audit trail of commands, file changes, and container states

This enables developers to work on multiple features simultaneously in completely isolated environments while maintaining full remote accessibility and development history.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create isolated worktree environments with dedicated containers, so that I can work on multiple features simultaneously without conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new worktree THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated Git branch and isolated file system
2. WHEN a worktree is created THEN the system SHALL automatically provision a Dagger container with the project dependencies
3. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL mount the worktree directory and configure the development environment
4. WHEN multiple worktrees exist THEN each SHALL have completely isolated dependencies and runtime environments
5. WHEN I switch between worktrees THEN the system SHALL maintain separate container states and configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the option to enable VibeTunnel for each worktree, so that I can share specific feature branches remotely when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VibeTunnel integration is enabled AND a worktree container starts THEN the system SHALL optionally create a dedicated VibeTunnel connection
2. WHEN multiple worktrees have tunneling enabled THEN each SHALL have unique tunnel URLs with branch-specific subdomains
3. WHEN I share a worktree URL THEN it SHALL provide access only to that specific branch and container
4. WHEN a worktree is deleted THEN the system SHALL automatically terminate its tunnel connection if one exists
5. WHEN VibeTunnel is disabled THEN worktrees SHALL function normally without any tunneling functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete history tracking for each worktree, so that I can audit all changes, commands, and container states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I execute commands in a worktree THEN the system SHALL log all commands with timestamps and outputs
2. WHEN files are modified THEN the system SHALL track all file changes with Git integration
3. WHEN container state changes THEN the system SHALL record container lifecycle events and configurations
4. WHEN I query worktree history THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logs of all activities
5. WHEN exporting history THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, markdown, Git log)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage worktrees through CLI commands, so that I can efficiently create, switch, and manage isolated development environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `bun worktree create <branch>` THEN the system SHALL create a new worktree with container and tunnel
2. WHEN I run `bun worktree list` THEN the system SHALL display all active worktrees with their status and URLs
3. WHEN I run `bun worktree switch <branch>` THEN the system SHALL activate the specified worktree environment
4. WHEN I run `bun worktree delete <branch>` THEN the system SHALL clean up the worktree, container, and tunnel
5. WHEN I run `bun worktree status` THEN the system SHALL show detailed information about the current worktree

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want worktree containers to automatically sync with my local development setup, so that each environment has consistent tooling and configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worktree container starts THEN it SHALL inherit the base project configuration and dependencies
2. WHEN I modify global development settings THEN existing worktrees SHALL optionally sync the changes
3. WHEN containers are rebuilt THEN they SHALL maintain worktree-specific customizations
4. WHEN dependency changes occur THEN the system SHALL efficiently update only affected containers
5. WHEN configuration conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize worktree-specific settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want worktrees to integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows, so that I can use familiar commands and tools within isolated environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm in a worktree THEN `bun dev` SHALL start the development server within the container
2. WHEN running tests THEN they SHALL execute in the isolated container environment
3. WHEN using Git commands THEN they SHALL operate on the worktree branch and history
4. WHEN accessing the database THEN each worktree SHALL have isolated data or clear separation
5. WHEN VibeTunnel integration is enabled THEN the tunnel SHALL automatically start with the development server

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient resource management for worktree containers, so that I can run multiple environments without overwhelming system resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN containers are idle THEN the system SHALL automatically pause or stop them to conserve resources
2. WHEN I switch to a paused worktree THEN the system SHALL quickly resume the container state
3. WHEN system resources are low THEN the system SHALL provide warnings and optimization suggestions
4. WHEN containers are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL clean up resources automatically
5. WHEN monitoring resource usage THEN the system SHALL provide clear metrics for each worktree

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to collaborate on worktrees with team members, so that we can share isolated development environments for code review and pair programming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I share a worktree URL THEN team members SHALL access the exact same development environment
2. WHEN multiple users access a worktree THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent access appropriately
3. WHEN collaborating on code THEN changes SHALL be properly tracked and attributed
4. WHEN sharing worktrees THEN security controls SHALL prevent unauthorized access
5. WHEN collaboration ends THEN the system SHALL provide options to merge or archive the shared work

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want worktree templates and presets, so that I can quickly create standardized development environments for different types of work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating worktrees THEN I SHALL be able to specify templates (feature, bugfix, experiment, etc.)
2. WHEN using templates THEN the system SHALL apply predefined configurations and dependencies
3. WHEN I create custom templates THEN they SHALL be reusable across projects and team members
4. WHEN templates are updated THEN existing worktrees SHALL optionally inherit the changes
5. WHEN sharing templates THEN they SHALL include container configurations and development settings

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive backup and restore capabilities for worktrees, so that I can preserve important development states and recover from issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I backup a worktree THEN the system SHALL capture the complete state including code, container, and history
2. WHEN restoring a worktree THEN the system SHALL recreate the exact development environment
3. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be efficiently stored with deduplication
4. WHEN I need to recover THEN the system SHALL provide point-in-time restoration options
5. WHEN sharing backups THEN they SHALL be portable across different development machines
